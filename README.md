###Hello, World

##What is the Shah Cipher?

The Shah Cipher is a project I wrote in High School to test out some encryption methods I was thinking of. Now, I've created an easy to use interface that lets the user see it in action.

##Plans

1. Allow for file encryption
  *  Should be usable like so: ```encrypt file.txt```
2. Implement a hashing system (like ```MD5```) so the algorithm becomes more secure
